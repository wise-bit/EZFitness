DROPSET: Strict Barbell Curls (4x8 @ RPE 10)

The bar used in a strict curl competition is an EZ, or cambered, barbell. Most gyms have EZ bars for biceps and triceps training. The camber or bend of the bar provides a comfortable hand and wrist position and also provides a fixed-grip width to ensure all lifters use the same hand placement on the bar.
