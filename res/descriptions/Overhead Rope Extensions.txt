-- HARDMODE --

(4x12 @ RPE 10)

Attach a rope to the bottom pulley of the pulley machine. Hold the rope with both hands, extend your arms with your hands directly above your heads using a neutral grip(palms facing each other). Elbows should close to your head and arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower the rope behind your head. Then slowly return to the starting position.
