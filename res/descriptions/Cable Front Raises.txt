SUPERSET: Cable Rear Delt Flys (4x12 @ RPE 10)

A rear delt fly done with dumbbells strengthens your upper back muscles and shoulders while working on stabilization strength in your spine, deep abdominals and hips. The exercise requires you to maintain a neutral spine position and avoid moving the torso.
