DROP SET: Strict Dumbbell Lateral Raises (3x8 @ RPE 10)
Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides. Keep your back straight, brace your core, and then slowly lift the weights out to the side until your arms are parallel with the floor, with the elbow slightly bent. ... You don't even need to use dumbbells â€“ a resistance band works well for lateral raises.
