Holding a barbell with a pronated grip, bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. Breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight.Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
