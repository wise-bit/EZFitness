-- INTERMEDIATE MODE --

Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm
