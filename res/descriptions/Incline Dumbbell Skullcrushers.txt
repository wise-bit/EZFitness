(3x12 @ RPE 9)

SUPERSET: Incline Tricep Kickbacks (same reps @ RPE 9)

Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. There should be a 90 - degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping your uppers arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended.
