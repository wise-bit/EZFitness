-- HARDMODE --

Close grip bench: 4x8 @ RPE 8
Weighted dips: 1x12, 1x10, 2x8 @ RPE 8

Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip about shoulder width, lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. Keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
